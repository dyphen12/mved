# Multi-variate Earning Dynamics
#
# Author: Alexis Wong (@dyphen12).
#
#
# This is a first implementation of the research on Earning Dynamics modeling improvement.
# which models the dynamics of an earning process. Here we implement an multi-variate approach.
#
# Based on the papers:
#
#  1) Daly,Hryshko - Improving measurement of earnings dynamics (Dec 2020).
#
#  2) Hryshko & Manovskii: Greatest Hits and All-Time Favorites (& Some That Will Be) (Oct 2020)

  # Given the equation

  # yit = Î±i + pit + Ï„it

  # pit = Ï†ppitâˆ’1 + Î¾it,

  # Ï„it = Î¸(L)it

  # yit is individual iâ€™s log-earnings (residuals) at time t;
  # pit is the permanent component (random walk if Ï†p = 1);
  # Ï„it is the transitory component: MA(1), ARMA(1,1),
  # AR(1), or iid;
  # Î±i is an individual fixed effect


  # Data Load

  # MARIMA Model
  #
  # 1) We train an MARIMA automatic model to obtain a full AR and MA coefficients of the multi-variate process.
  #
  # 2) Then, we train an ARIMA (1,0,1) model to obtain the resources of this model as seen in the paper.
  #
  # 3) We build an autoARIMA + ARIMA (1,0,1) model.
  #
  # 4) We have that a model of the permanent effect of the shock is equivalent to a Random Walk
  #    model first order of differentiation,
  #    we simulate this with the previously obtained model and thus we obtain this resource.
